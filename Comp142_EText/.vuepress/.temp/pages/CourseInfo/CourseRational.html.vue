<p>In this course, students will peer into the lowest levels of a general-purpose computer. Facebook, the Mars Rover, and a Tesla all have the same basic low-level structure, organization, and tradeoffs</p>
<p>This course will cover what computers consist of, how computers work, how they are organized internally, what are the design tradeoffs, and how design affects programming and applications</p>
