### [A Bit of History](History)
A brief look are the technological events that got us here

### [Number Systems](NumberSystems)
The binary number system is the core data type that represents all information in modern computers

Binary is used in all digital things, from a text message to the newest streaming video
The information and systems that get the information to us are all using Binary

### [Digital Logic and Circuits](DigitalLogicCircuits) 
Digital Logic is the set of operations that can be applied binary information to compare and change it. It is, in effect, the math behind modern computers

Digital Circuits are physical implementations of Digital Logic. Transistors are the core of Digital Circuits because they behave like Binary storage units. When connected in series and parallel, transistors create circuits that make decisions, control data, and store binary values

Digital Logic and Circuits, when designed and implemented correctly, can do things we needs done, such as capture an image, send an e-mail, and guide a rocket to the correct orbit

### [Pioneers](Pioneers/)
While computers have been evolving since the humans developed numbers and counting in fingers, modern computers have their roots in 20th century

Even before the technology existed to build a digital computer, scientists were developing the theories and designs that would eventual create the modern computer

Among these scientists are a few key people that layed the foundation upon which today's technology-rich world is built
